And here again, it is important to choose the right product for your skin type. For oily skin, a light oil-free product with conditioning properties will be good, and for dry skin - a thicker, deeply hydrating one. At this stage, do not forget about sun protection. Day moisturiser with SPF can be used immediately or apply a separate layer of protection over the moisturiser."
